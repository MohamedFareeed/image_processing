# License Plate Recognition (LPR) - Image Processing

This project implements **License Plate Recognition** using image processing techniques. It detects and extracts vehicle license plates from images, then recognizes the characters using OCR.

## Key Features

- Automatic license plate detection via contour analysis or object detection models.
- Image preprocessing (grayscale, blur, edge detection) for accurate detection.
- Character segmentation and recognition using Tesseract OCR.
- Works on static images and can be extended for real-time video.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- (Optional) Deep learning models like YOLO for detection

## Use Cases

- Smart parking management
- Traffic law enforcement
- Toll automation
- Vehicle tracking systems

## How It Works (Pipeline Overview)

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Convert image to grayscale
   - Apply noise reduction and edge detection
2. **License Plate Detection**:
   - Use contour filtering or object detection to find the plate area
3. **Plate Extraction**:
   - Crop the detected region of interest (ROI)
4. **Text Recognition**:
   - Use Tesseract OCR to read characters from the plate
5. **Result Output**:
   - Return or display the recognized license number

This project is a simple yet effective implementation of image-based license plate recognition, useful in real-world applications involving traffic automation and vehicle identification.

Output: Return recognized license number.
