License Plate Recognition 
🚗 License Plate Recognition (LPR)
This project implements License Plate Recognition using image processing techniques. It detects and extracts vehicle license plates from input images and recognizes the alphanumeric characters using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

🔍 Key Features
Automatic license plate detection using contour analysis or pre-trained object detection models.

Image preprocessing (grayscale, noise reduction, edge detection) for better plate isolation.

Character segmentation and recognition using Tesseract OCR or deep learning-based models.

Supports static images and can be extended for real-time video streams.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

Tesseract OCR

(Optional) YOLO or other object detection models

📂 Use Cases
Smart parking systems

Traffic monitoring

Automated toll collection

Vehicle tracking and law enforcement

🧠 How it Works (Overview)
Preprocessing: Convert the image to grayscale, apply blur, and detect edges.

Plate Detection: Find contours and filter for rectangular shapes likely to be plates.

Plate Extraction: Crop the region of interest (ROI).

OCR Recognition: Use Tesseract to extract text from the plate.

Output: Return recognized license number.
